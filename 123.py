Calculate the computational cost savings of an MoE layer compared to a dense layer, as discussed in the paper 'Outrageously Large Neural Networks: The Sparsely-Gated Mixture-of-Experts Layer.' 
Given the number of experts, sparsity (number of active experts), and input/output dimensions, compute the floating-point operations (FLOPs) for both and determine the savings percentage.
Example:
Input:
compute_efficiency(1000, 2, 512, 512)
Output:
99.8
Reasoning:
Dense layer FLOPs: 1000 * 512 * 512 = 262,144,000. MoE FLOPs: 2 * 512 * 512 = 524,288. Savings: ((262,144,000 - 524,288) / 262,144,000) x 100 ≈ 99.8%.
